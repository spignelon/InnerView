# InnerView: : Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition
InnerView is a real-time facial emotion recognition project developed using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, MobileNetV2, and transfer learning. It allows for efficient recognition of facial emotions in real-time applications.

## Features

- Real-time Emotion Recognition using MobileNetV2
- Transfer learning on the FER2013 dataset
- Lightweight architecture for optimal real-time performance
